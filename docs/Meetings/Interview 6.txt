Q:
What exactly do you mean when you say that each part of the system should affect another during creation?
A:
- Put yourself in position of a teacher
- Bringing the end goal together to the final goal is the final product
	Example of product and the problem: Examination is a product, the problem is linked to achieve to achieving high marks on the examination
- Who? - Think about broad interests that cater to the whos
	When creating the learning unit, capture the future aspirations of the whos instead.
- Could just put the different sections side by side, thinking about how these areas are connected via activities to give rise to the shared problem, the purpose and the product
- There could be search functionality for public units based on subcomponents of the phases.
- Popup boxes when hovering over sections of text 
- Short videos
