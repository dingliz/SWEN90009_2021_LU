# SWEN90009_2021_LU
## Introduction
This project is about developing a web interface for the Creative Learning Unit framework which guides teachers through the creation of such learning units. It integrates the concept of the 3-dimensional model for "what to achieve in the end", "how to teach" and "who is involved" and encourages unit designers to focus on the human experience and identity of learners/students as opposed to a traditional learning unit design. The system provides assistance during the creation of learning units and also allows users to share the learning units and collaborate with others.

This repository stores the outputs of each sprint and shares them with the client. It keeps the history of the developing process and allows the client track the progress conveniently.
