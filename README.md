# SWEN90009_2021_LU
## Introduction
This project is about developing a web interface for the Creative Learning Unit framework which guides teachers through the creation of such learning units. It integrates the concept of the 3-dimensional model for "what to achieve in the end", "how to teach" and "who is involved" and encourages unit designers to focus on the human experience and identity of learners/students as opposed to a traditional learning unit design. The system provides assistance during the creation of learning units and also allows users to share the learning units and collaborate with others.

This repository stores the outputs of each sprint and shares them with the client. It keeps the history of the developing process and allows the client track the progress conveniently.

## Decriptions of work

### Requirements
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/tree/main/docs) to see all files related to requirements.

The requirements of the system involve files which describe all the functionalities, the users, the motivations, and the contexts behind the project itself. They are crucial for the development of the system since they provide developers with the information necessary to proceed with the system's creation.

### Prototypes
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/tree/main/prototypes) to view all the prototypes

The prototypes of the system are various representations of the UI for the final product. It contains the low fidelity (paper prototype), high fidelity (digital prototype), and the moodboard used for the design of the system.

### UI Assets
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/tree/main/prototypes) to view all the images used in the development of the UI prototypes

### Data Samples
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/tree/main/data%20samples) to view all the data samples used in the development of the high fidelity prototype

Data samples are examples of real-world data which are supposed to be used within the system itself, to represent what information the system is supposed to take under execution.

### Meeting Minutes
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/tree/main/docs/Meetings) to view all the meeting minutes for the requirements section of the prototype

### Project Overview
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/blob/main/docs/Specifications/Project%20Overview.pdf) to view the overview for the project.

The project overview briefly describes the purpose of the project to any reader, and should provide them with enough understanding of the context behind the project so they have a basic idea of what the project itself entails

### Requirement Elicitation
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/blob/main/docs/Specifications/Requirements%20Elicitation.pdf) to see the methods used for requirements elicitation.

Requirements elicitation techniques involve the way information regarding the requirements are supposed to be obtained. This was mainly done through interviewing the client.

### Motivational Model
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/blob/main/docs/Specifications/Motivational%20Model.pdf) to see the motivational model created in this project

The motivational model describes the motivations of the users to use the end product

### Personas
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/tree/main/docs/Specifications/Personas) to see the personas which represent the users in this project.

Personas are representations of real users on the end-product. They contain information pertaining to the motivations behind these users to use the product itself.

### User Stories
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/blob/main/docs/Specifications/User%20Stories.pdf)

User stories are concrete representation for the end product and its features. They encapsulate what the users should be able to do on the product.

### Paper Prototype
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/tree/main/prototypes/low%20fidelity) to see the paper prototype used in this system.

Paper prototypes are supposed to be low fidelity imitations of the system, used to evaluate basic designs for the UI.

### MoodBoard
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/blob/main/prototypes/Moodboard.pdf) to see the moodboards used in the design process.

Moodboards describe the "feel" of the design of the project itself. It contains images and similar materials which are used to determine what the application looks like.

### Digital Prototype
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/blob/main/prototypes/high%20fidelity) to access the Axure files used in the development of the prototype.
Click [here](https://l2lpj3.axshare.com) to access an online version of the prototype.

The digital prototype is an imitation of the real product, used for usability tests and gathering information from the client about the end product.

### Acceptance Criteria and Tests
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/tree/main/tests) to access the acceptance criterion and tests.

Acceptance criteria are the pieces of information describing what must be achieved in order for a user story to be marked as "finished" during development. Accpetance tests therefore describe a set of steps used to determine if an acceptance criteria has been achieved.

### Requirements Traceability Matrix
Click [here](https://github.com/dingliz/SWEN90009_2021_LU/blob/main/tests/Requirement%20Traceability%20Matrix.pdf) to view the requirements traceability matrix.

The requirements traceability matrix is a grid which correlates user stories/acceptance criteria to the relevant test which would evaluate whether those acceptance criteria have been met.
