# SWEN90009_2021_LU
## Introduction
This project is about developing a web interface for the Creative Learning Unit framework which guides teachers through the creation of such learning units. It integrates the concept of the 3-dimensional model for "what to achieve in the end", "how to teach" and "who is involved" and encourages unit designers to focus on the human experience and identity of learners/students as opposed to a traditional learning unit design. The system provides assistance during the creation of learning units and also allows users to share the learning units and collaborate with others.

This repository stores the outputs of each sprint and shares them with the client. It keeps the history of the developing process and allows the client track the progress conveniently.

## Changelog
### SPRINT 1
SWEN90009_2021_LU_Wombat_BL_SPRINT1
#### Create project overview
The project overview briefly describes the purpose of the project to any reader, and should provide them with enough understanding of the context behind the project so they have a basic idea of what the project itself entails

#### Decide of Requirements Eliciation Techniques
Requirements elicitation techniques involve the way information regarding the requirements are supposed to be obtained. This was mainly done through interviewing the client.

### SPRINT 2
SWEN90009_2021_LU_Wombat_BL_SPRINT2
#### Create motivational model
The motivational model describes the motivations of the users to use the end product

#### Create personas
Personas are representations of real users on the end-product. They contain information pertaining to the motivations behind these users to use the product itself.

### SPRINT 3
SWEN90009_2021_LU_Wombat_BL_SPRINT3
#### Create user stories
User stories are concrete representation for the end product and its features. They encapsulate what the users should be able to do on the product.

#### Created paper prototype
Paper prototypes are supposed to be low fidelity imitations of the system, used to evaluate basic designs for the UI.

### SPRINT 4
SWEN90009_2021_LU_Wombat_BL_SPRINT4
#### Create digital prototype
The digital prototype is a imitation of the real product, used for usability tests and gathering information from the client about the end product.

#### Create moodboard
Moodboards describe the "feel" of the design of the project itself. It contains images and similar materials which are used to determine what the application looks like.

#### Create acceptance criterion and acceptance tests
Acceptance criteria are the pieces of information describing what must be achieved in order for a user story to be marked as "finished" during development. Accpetance tests therefore describe a set of steps used to determine if an acceptance criteria has been achieved.

#### Create requirement tracebility matrix
The traceability matrix involves formulating a grid which explains which user stories/acceptance criteria correspond to which tests in the end-product.

#### Uploaded data samples
Data samples are examples of real-world data which are supposed to be used within the system itself, to represent what information the system is supposed to take under execution.
